# Rainfall-Onset-Demise-Duration
Different codes to analyze rainfall characteristics, in particular to define onset, demise (and therefore duration). 

% Matlab script to compute onset/demise (and duration)
% AG Munoz (IRI Columbia U) - agmunoz@iri.columbia.edu and Carlos Martinez - carlos.martinez@columbia.edu
% Project: Predictability of the onset, duration and demise of the North and South American Monsoon Systems: 
% the role of cross-equatorial interactions
% First edition: Aug 4, 2017 
% Last edition: Feb 21, 2018
% Notes: 
% + Subset of the full code written for the N/S American Monsoon
%   project, to show the Bombardi and Carvalho approach. 
% + Code reads rainfall data for indicated coordinates (1 gridbox) directly
%   from the IRI Data Library (CPC-Unified - Chen et al 2008).
% + For illustration purposes, only one gridbox/station is used.
% + The method has issues when the year is too dry (as one should expect).
