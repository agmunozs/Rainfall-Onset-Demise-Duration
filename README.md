# Rainfall-Onset-Demise-Duration
Different codes to analyze rainfall characteristics, in particular to define onset, demise (and therefore duration). 

Present version works for uni-modal rainfall cycles. Bi-modals are relatively easy to implement.

Write to me if you're planning to use any of these codes, and consider co-authorship if appropriate.
